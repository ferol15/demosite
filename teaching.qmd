## Teaching Statement

My teaching focuses on helping students develop a scientific approach to politics across all course levels. This involves three key elements: First, I emphasize scientific literacy by distinguishing social science from journalistic and rhetorical approaches, showing how we seek systematic patterns rather than explaining single events or advocating positions. Second, I demonstrate the value of scientific methods both for deepening understanding and informing effective public policy. Finally, I guide students in conducting their own research, both individually and collaboratively, transforming them from consumers to creators of political knowledge.
Through interactive learning experiences, hands-on research projects, and real-world applications, I help students build analytical skills that serve them beyond the classroom while maintaining an inclusive environment where students from all backgrounds can engage meaningfully with quantitative methods.

## Teaching Tools

To support hands-on learning, I have been developing <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/fatiherol/erol-app" target="_blank">interactive web applications</a> (though currently in an experimental phase) that would allow students to conduct statistical analyses without programming barriers, making quantitative methods more accessible across different technical backgrounds.

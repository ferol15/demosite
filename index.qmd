I am an Assistant Professor at <a href="https://iibf.yeditepe.edu.tr/en/political-science-and-international-relations-department-en" target="_blank"> the Department of Political Science and International Relations at Yeditepe University</a>. My research spans several interconnected domains that bridge **biological** and **political science**. My work on **chronobiology** investigates how sleep patterns and circadian rhythms align with political ideology and civic participation across multiple countries and over time, connecting fundamental biological processes to political outcomes. Additionally, my research examines the alignment between **existential threats** and **ideological orientation**, as well as the connections between **polarization** and **democratic attitudes**.

My methodological expertise extends to **experimental research**, **survey methodology**, **advanced regression modeling** (multilevel modeling \[with post-stratification\], structural equation modeling, categorical data analysis, and several quasi-experimental designs), and **text-as-data approaches**, along with hands-on experience with **physiological data** collection and analysis (such as skin conductance and functional magnetic resonance imaging).\

I have extensive experience with **<i>R</i>** and **Stata**. I am comfortable programming advanced experiments and surveys in **Qualtrics** using **JavaScript** (including choice-based conjoint experiments and implicit association tests), creating interactive data analysis and visualization dashboards with **<i>R</i> Shiny**, and employing **Python** through **PsychoPy** for experimental programming. I have also utilized **Unix** and **FSL** for neuroimaging data analysis in interdisciplinary research projects.\

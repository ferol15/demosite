[1] **Erol, F.** Bridging the gap: How mass-elite affective polarization congruence affects democratic attitudes.\
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Scholars have long assumed that alignment between citizens and elites strengthens democratic legitimacy, yet this relationship remains untested for affective polarization. This study introduces the concept of <i>affective polarization congruence</i> (the perceived emotional alignment between citizens and their party's representatives) and tests its causal effects on democratic attitudes through a novel experimental design. In a pre-registered experiment, U.S. partisans received manipulated feedback about whether their representatives' partisan affect exceeded, fell short of, or matched their own. Against theoretical expectations, participants in conditions portraying affective congruence as "healthy democratic responsiveness" showed significantly decreased support for democracy as a system of government. A composite measure combining democratic satisfaction and principled democratic support revealed similar erosion across multiple congruence conditions. These findings challenge conventional wisdom about representation, suggesting citizens may be growing weary of normalizing polarization, regardless of how it is framed. Even "democratically framed" emotional alignment appears to trigger democratic fatigue.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
The mass-elite congruence in politics is key to a healthy democracy. Existing research uses the match between citizens' ideological positions and those of political elites and parties to assess satisfaction with democracy over time and across countries. However, mass-elite ideological congruence does not necessarily guarantee mass-elite overlap in ideological polarization, the implications of which for democratic satisfaction are little known. Accordingly, our article examines the link between the mass-elite ideological polarization congruence and democratic satisfaction in a multinational context. We reason that when polarized electorates feel let down by their parties' depolarization, these ideologically polarized people would grow frustrated with the disconnected democratic system (seen as ineffective in meeting citizens' expectations and delivering meaningful political alternatives). Then, we find that electorates who do not consider their affiliated parties to be as ideologically polarized as themselves tend to be dissatisfied with the way democracy works in their countries. Our additional inquiries suggest that this democratic dissatisfaction parallels ambivalence in democratic commitment. We also find that the perception of no differences between parties, and affiliation with populist and losing parties amplifies these disappointed polarized electorates’ dissatisfaction with democracy.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
How do mortality reminders and aroused mortality fear affect people’s conservatism? Threats-politics studies assume that life-threatening dangers, fear of death, and conservatism go together, overlooking the distinction between threat exposure and mortality fear arousal. Further, these studies commonly fixate on the conventional threat of terrorism and predominantly employ samples from Western countries. Complementing past research, I use three survey experiments in Turkey to investigate the relationship between a broad array of threats (terrorism, health risks, moral hazards, and daily thoughts of death’s inevitability), mortality fear induced by the threats, and self-rated conservative orientation in a causal mediation analysis framework, using the terror management theory and non-representative Facebook samples (2018, 2020). The results reveal that the respondents receiving threatening stimuli (particularly terrorism mortality reminder) become less conservative as the mortality fear elevates. The length of mortality priming and the broader study context influence this indirect effect’s significance and replicability.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Sleep is fundamental to life and essential to one’s health behavior, scholastic achievement, and work performance. Recent years have seen an increase in empirical investigations incorporating sleep research into political science. This study complements existing sleep-politics studies by examining the associations between chronotype (a person’s preferred time to sleep and wake up) and attitudinal and behavioral political outcomes (left–right ideology and social conservatism proxied by religious service attendance). We analyze representative samples from 10 national contexts (Finland, Greece, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, and Switzerland) to test our hypotheses. The results demonstrate that morning chronotype has significant links with political conservatism in six national contexts depending on model specification (most robustly in Switzerland). Unexpectedly, the morning chronotype may have links to liberalism in three other countries depending on model specification (most robustly in Russia). The results for religious observance are more uniform, indicating a link between morningness and greater religious observance across all cases in many specifications (excepting a reversed relationship in New Zealand in some models). Urbanization, seasonal effects, geographical characteristics, and religious denominations are explored as potential confounders.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Receiving a healthy amount of sleep is essential to one's quality of life. Both sleep-wake timing preferences (chronotype) and sleep duration are implicated in health, academic achievement, and workplace performance. This study complements the existing sleep–politics literature by examining the associations between sleep duration, chronotype, and turnout with a representative cross-national survey dataset from nine national contexts. Our analyses demonstrate that greater sleep duration is non-linearly related to higher turnout; those who sleep too little or too much are less likely to vote. The results also show that morning chronotype is associated with higher turnout, but controlling for religiosity attenuates this relationship. We argue that healthy sleep duration and chronotype lay at the intersection of the socioeconomic and psychological resources necessary to participate in elections.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Building upon past findings on terrorism and individual-level politically conservative self-identification, I evaluate the effect of terrorism mortality reminders on conservative self-placement with three survey experiments, using non-representative Facebook samples in Turkey (2018, 2020). The scant existing experimental findings outside the usual Northwestern European and North American environment make it difficult to assess how the context (e.g., the longevity and diversity of terrorism problems in a country) can explain the alignment between terrorism threats and conservatism. In non-Western areas such as Turkey, with various types of terrorism over time, the link between terrorism threat and conservatism may remain uniform. However, the fear of death in a terrorist attack elicited by the terrorism mortality salience would create psychological strain and make individuals suppress terrorism-related death-thoughts by moving away from conservatism, reminding them of the human body’s vulnerability to threats and igniting fearfulness. Using the Terror Management Theory perspective, this study explored the causal mechanism running from terrorism mortality reminder to terrorism mortality fear to conservative self-identification. In all three studies, conservatism decreased when the respondents felt fearful of terrorism mortality and the treated respondents became more conservative if the terrorism mortality fear was kept at its average value (as a covariate).

[5] **Erol, F.**, Ksiazkiewicz, A., & Micatka, N. K. Waking up to politics: How sleep quality relates to political participation.
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Getting restful sleep is essential to people’s academic achievement, cognitive functioning, life satisfaction, mental and physical health, pro-sociality, and vigilance. Our study translates these insights for political science by examining the relationship of sleep quality with turnout and non-electoral participation across the fourteen countries in four major datasets. Using a multilevel approach, we find that getting good sleep is strongly linked with a higher likelihood of turnout, with sizeable effects. Conversely, we find that poor sleep quality motivates greater non-electoral political participation. Additional analyses contrast past work on sleep quantity and indicate greater relative explanatory power for sleep quality over quantity on turnout. We also find that these results are robust to asynchronous timing between sleep quality and civic participation measures.  We argue that creating societies where high-quality sleep is accessible to the public is vital to the sustainability of democratic regimes.

[4] **Erol, F.**, Grillo, M. C., & Christman, S. D. Hands on politics: Unpacking the link between handedness and ideological orientation in a multilevel framework.
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
We examine the relationship between handedness and ideological orientation using comprehensive cross-national panel data from 19 European countries in a multilevel framework through two complementary theoretical frameworks: motivated social cognition and cognitive inflexibility. Our findings reveal a robust association between self-reported right-hand dominance and conservative political orientation, with effect sizes comparable to established personality predictors like <i>Openness</i>. More intriguingly, we uncover a U-shaped relationship between consistent handedness (measured via grip strength asymmetry) and ideological extremism, suggesting that individuals with pronounced hand dominance—whether left or right—exhibit greater propensity toward extreme political positions. This pattern supports theories linking cognitive inflexibility to authoritarianism across the ideological spectrum.
Additional analyses reveal important conditional effects: the handedness-ideology relationship is moderated by <i>Conscientiousness</i>, with highly conscientious individuals showing stronger rightward shifts when right-hand dominant. Gender also conditions the extremism relationship, with women displaying greater sensitivity to handedness effects. These results provide the first large-scale, cross-national evidence that biological asymmetries may systematically relate to political cognition. Our findings suggest that embodied cognition theories merit serious consideration in political psychology. The study advances understanding of how fundamental neurobiological differences might contribute to political polarization and ideological sorting in democratic societies.

[3] Ksiazkiewicz, A., & **Erol, F.** Where you stand depends on when you sleep: A cross-lagged panel model analysis of the interplay between chronotype and political ideology. 
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Chronotype (preferred sleep/wake schedule) influences various life outcomes. Recent studies associate morning types with political conservatism across several democracies, but the causality between chronotype and ideology remains unclear. We examine four theoretical possibilities: chronotype predisposes people toward certain political beliefs; political ideologies shape sleep-wake preferences; shared genetic characteristics influence both; or reciprocal causation exists between them. Using cross-lagged panel model analysis with the Add Health dataset, we test these causal pathways. Our results support a unidirectional influence: chronotype significantly predicts political ideology during the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Specifically, morning-type individuals tend to develop more conservative self-identification over time. We find no evidence for reverse causality (ideology predicting chronotype), genetic confounding, or reciprocal causation. These findings highlight the importance of biological rhythms in shaping political belief systems, though they should be replicated in other longitudinal studies and experimental research.

[2] **Erol, F.**, Groman, J., & Braithwaite, A. From conflict zone allies to welcome home, allies: How Afghan immigrants’ collaboration with the U.S. affects public attitudes towards immigration.
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Research on public attitudes toward immigration assumes judgments depend on prospective evaluations of whether immigrants will benefit/harm host societies. However, memory and learning shape outgroup bias, suggesting information about past contributions could alter evaluations. We test whether combining immigrants’ past service with future potential affects Americans’ attitudes toward Afghan Special Immigrant Visa applicants who served U.S. military-diplomatic missions. Using four experiments across two nationally representative samples, we manipulate temporal framing in recommendation letters through vignette experiments (past only, future only, or both) and randomize immigrant profiles in conjoint experiments. Vignette experiments show combining past and future contributions increases open-door policy support and positive emotions. Conjoint experiments reveal dual temporal framing enhances admission prioritization in forced-choice comparisons but not absolute ratings, suggesting comparative evaluations activate different decision processes than independent assessments. Including narratives about past service strengthens cases when paired with future potential, offering insights for immigration policymaking and advocacy.

[1] **Erol, F.** Nothing good comes out of death? The effects of anthropocentric and ecocentric mortality salience on climate change beliefs and policy preferences.
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
While extensive research has examined how threats relate to ideological orientation, little is known about whether mortality reminders, particularly regarding future generations, influence climate change beliefs and environmental policy preferences. This study investigates how different forms of mortality salience would impact environmental attitudes through online survey experiments with multiple non-random samples in the US. Using a between-subjects design, the research examines three distinct mortality primes compared to a control condition with no experimental priming: (i) reminder of one's own mortality alone, (ii) a reminder of one's mortality combined with the extinction of future generations on an uninhabitable planet, or (iii) a reminder of one's mortality coupled with assured symbolic immortality through future generations. The key question is whether environmental attitudes shift when individuals contemplate not only their own death but also the potential loss of their ideational and genetic continuity through Earth's deterioration. The study later measures participants' views on climate change evidence, perceived threats, policy preferences, and information-seeking behaviors. Preliminary findings from a student sample reveal that symbolic immortality priming significantly and substantially enhances environmental engagement (e.g., information-seeking and talking about climate change and pro-environmental sacrifice willingness), even after covariate and multiple comparisons adjustment. By uncovering how existential fears and hopes drive climate attitudes, this research offers critical insights for more effective messaging, policy interventions, and public engagement in addressing global environmental challenges.

<details>
<summary>Synopsis</summary>
This book project argues that sleep represents an overlooked but critical resource in democratic life, comparable to money, time, and civic skills in determining who participates in politics and how they form political beliefs. The research investigates how America's widespread sleep crisis may have profound consequences for democratic participation and political polarization, operating through multiple pathways where sleep-deprived citizens potentially lack the cognitive capacity for effective political engagement while individual sleep preferences systematically relate to ideological orientation. The study examines how morning types, who align with society's 9-to-5 schedule, appear more likely to hold conservative attitudes that support existing systems, while evening types experience temporal displacement that may foster more liberal, change-oriented politics. The democratic implications are significant as sleep inequality mirrors and amplifies existing social disparities, creating compounding disadvantages where already marginalized communities face additional barriers to political participation through declining sleep quality and quantity, representing a new dimension of political inequality that has received little scholarly attention. The research employs multi-level analyses, experimental interventions, twin studies, panel data analyses, and original representative cross-sectional surveys with comprehensive measures of chronotype, sleep quality, quantity, health indicators, and political attitudes covering ideology, polarization, and civic participation to establish causal direction, spanning from aggregate electoral patterns to individual political development and demonstrating how sleep deficits relate to reduced democratic engagement while chronotype aligns with ideological formation from adolescence through adulthood. The final chapters explore policy solutions, examining how workplace reforms, extended voting access, and public health interventions could strengthen democratic participation by addressing sleep inequality, ultimately introducing chronobiology to political science and opening new frontiers for understanding how biological rhythms and social institutions interact to shape democratic citizenship in contemporary America.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Which parties use simple language in their election manifestoes, and do simple election documents resonate with voters’ most pressing problems? This chapter displays the alignment between the political parties' wordings in the election documents and citizens’ responses concerning Turkey's most pressing issues. Theoretically, it is expected that parties with populist leanings are more likely to simplify their election documents to appeal to a broader public. In turn, voters should perceive and process more straightforward election documents to have an idea of what are the country's problems. As a way forward, we find the 2018 Turkish elections puzzling because there are two electoral alliances with populist entitlements to the people and the nation, the People's Alliance by AKP and MHP, and the Nation Alliance by CHP, IYIP, and SP. We evaluate whether political parties' endeavors to stand for the people/nation have any implications for Turkish election manifestoes’ and voters’ language, precisely the level of sophistication in argumentation and the ability to communicate the arguments. To this end, our research presents a measure of complexity and communication to assess the language of parties' election documents and voters’ open-ended survey responses before the 2018 presidential and parliamentary elections. Our results show that most of the political parties borrow wordings from each other's manifestoes. Besides, partisans carefully check what other partisan citizens say or do not say when naming the country's problems. We observe that the easier readability of a party's manifesto affects a party's access to a broader audience to define the most critical issues during the campaign period. The findings lead to a greater understanding of mass-elite linkages during election campaigns and have significant consequences for the future analyses of manifesto and survey data.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
This study examines how political parties in Turkey have embraced populism from the late Ottoman Empire to present day, challenging the notion that populism belongs to any single party or ideology. Through comparative historical analysis, we trace three key dimensions of populism—people-centrism, anti-elitism, and appeals to popular will—across Turkey's political spectrum. Our research reveals that Russian populism (Narodism) initially inspired late 19th-century Ottoman intellectuals, particularly the Committee of Union and Progress, who cultivated peasant populism in Turkey. The founders of the Turkish Republic later institutionalized these ideas through the Republican People's Party (CHP), making populism a defining feature of Turkish politics that persisted through democratic transition.
Different political traditions have defined "the people" distinctly: center-right parties like the Democratic Party emphasized "people as sovereigns," the CHP in the 1970s focused on "common people" oppressed by economic elites, while Milli Görüş parties promoted "people as Islamic nation." The AK Party has synthesized these approaches, positioning itself as defender of Turkey's authentic people and oppressed Muslims globally. Elite definitions have similarly evolved based on parties' ideological positions and power status—from economic exploiters to civil-military bureaucracy to foreign powers and domestic collaborators. This historical pervasiveness across the ideological spectrum suggests that populist turns can emerge from various political crises, offering insights for understanding populism beyond Western European contexts and enriching comparative populism literature.
